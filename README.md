![Analog clock code](images/11analogcode.png) <br />
This is the analog clock code which i have used for the output.\


### Task 2: Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration

####  a. Ajax:

I have added a new HTML code for a user input such as `<input>`, a `<button>`, and a `<div>` element with JavaScript code into my page. I have attached the screenshots here.\

![Ajax](images/12ajax.png) <br />
Here, This is the output of ajax code where, the user input taken and when the new button is clicked it is given output.I have  constructed and sent an Ajax GET request to the `echo.php` web application which was taken from already written code in Lab 1 and that HTTP response displayed the response content in the <div> element in the code so that it can easily displayed on browser.
\
![Ajax output](images/13ajaxoutput.png)<br />

![ajaxresponse](images/17ajaxresponse.png)<br />
This is the repose Which I have got for the jquery in the browser.\
![ajax response code](images/18.2ajaxresponsecode.png)<br />
This is the reponse code for the jquery.<br> \

I have written a JavaScript code using jQuery Ajax that is used to send a request and handle the response by displaying a random joke from the above API when the page is loaded without refreshing the page and inpected the network in the browser.<br>

d.(ii)\
![fetch results](images/23fetchresults.png)<br />
